This rails 3 app was made to show a problem that I came across when trying to add some fields to a devise User table. I made the views as suggested in the documentation for devise and then edited the views/devise/registrations edit and new files to make the form input the data into the table in the appropreate slots. Since this is a skeleton, you must know to go to /users/sign_up and users/edit to see that the username and admin fields do not get saved to the database. Another way to see this same thing is with "User.first" in the console.
